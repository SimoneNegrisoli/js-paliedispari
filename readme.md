## Description

### Palindroma

Ask the user to enter a word
Create a function to understand if the entered word is a palindrome

### Even and odd

The user chooses even or odd and enters a number from 1 to 5.
We generate a random number (always from 1 to 5) for the computer (obviously using a :nerd_face: function).
Let's add the two numbers
We establish whether the sum of the two numbers is even or odd (obviously using a :nerd_face: function)
Let's declare who won.
